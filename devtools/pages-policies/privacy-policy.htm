<p class="is-size-7 is-italics">Last Updated: January 16, 2019</p>

<p>Welcome to the POPin Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand how POP Inc. and its
  affiliates and subsidiaries (<span class="has-text-weight-bold">“POPin”, “we”, “us”, “our”</span>) collect, use,
  process, share and safeguard Personal Information gathered through our website (<a href="www.popinnow.com" title="POP, Inc.">www.popinnow.com</a>),
  our mobile applications, our other products and services, and via other means. In this Privacy Policy, <span class="has-text-weight-bold">“Personal
    Information”</span> means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies when POPin is a “data controller”, which means that POPin decides why and how Personal
  Information is processed. POPin provides a crowdsourcing platform (the <span class="has-text-weight-bold">“Platform”</span>)
  to companies and organizations (<span class="has-text-weight-bold">“Customers”</span>), which enables Customer to
  invite employees or other individuals (<span class="has-text-weight-bold">“Platform Users”</span>) to share
  information. When using the Platform, the Customer is the data controller and decides how and why Personal
  Information is processed. Please contact the relevant Customer if you are a Platform User and have questions about
  their privacy policies and practices.</p>

<p>We’re glad you’re taking the time to read this Privacy Policy. If after reading through this you still have
  additional questions, please contact us. We’re happy to help.</p>

    <h5>ANONYMOUS PARTICIPATION AT POPin</h5>
    <p>When participating in a POPin, you may elect not to disclose your identity to the company that organizes the
      POPin (our Customer). This is a key feature of POPin which we call anonymous participation. If you participate
      anonymously, whether answering a question, voting, or commenting, we will not share your identity with our
      Customer, unless required to do so by law. However, it is possible that the Customer could guess or infer that
      you provided a response based on the content of the response.</p>
