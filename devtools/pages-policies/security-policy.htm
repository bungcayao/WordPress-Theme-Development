<h3>Security Assessments and Compliance</h3>
<h4>Data Centers</h4>
<p>POPin’s physical infrastructure is hosted and managed within Amazon’s secure data centers and utilize the Amazon Web
Service (AWS) technology. Amazon continually manages risk and undergoes recurring assessments to ensure compliance with
industry standards. Amazon’s data center operations have been accredited under:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ISO 27001</li>
  <li>SOC 1 and SOC 2/SSAE 16/ISAE 3402 (Previously SAS 70 Type II)</li>
  <li>PCI Level 1</li>
  <li>FISMA Moderate</li>
  <li>Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Physical Security</h3>
<p>POPin utilizes ISO 27001 and FISMA certified data centers managed by Amazon. Amazon has many years of experience in
  designing, constructing, and operating large-scale data centers. This experience has been applied to the AWS platform
  and infrastructure. AWS data centers are housed in nondescript facilities, and critical facilities have extensive
  setback and military grade perimeter control berms as well as other natural boundary protection. Physical access is
  strictly controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security staff utilizing
  video surveillance, state of the art intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff must
  pass two-factor authentication no fewer than three times to access data center floors. All visitors and contractors
  are required to present identification and are signed in and continually escorted by authorized staff.</p>

<p>Amazon only provides data center access and information to employees who have a legitimate business need for such
  privileges. When an employee no longer has a business need for these privileges, his or her access is immediately
  revoked, even if they continue to be an employee of Amazon or Amazon Web Services. All physical and electronic access
  to data centers by Amazon employees is logged and audited routinely.</p>

<h3>System Security</h3>
<h4>System Configuration</h4>
<p>System configuration and consistency is maintained via custom configuration management software that is version
  controlled, peer reviewed, and tested thoroughly before implementing in our Production environment. We use AWS Best
  Practice tools to enforce Infrastructure and Application security.</p>

<h4>System Authentication</h4>
<p>Operating system access is limited to the POPin Development Team and requires username, key, and IP authentication.
  Operating systems do not allow password authentication to prevent password brute force attacks, theft, and sharing.</p>

<h3>Network Security</h3>
<h4>Segmentation</h4>
<p>POPin Production and Staging environments network segments are completely isolated and independent of each other.
  There is no data sharing between them. All Customer data is only hosted in the Production environment.</p>

<h4>Firewalls</h4>
<p>Firewalls are utilized to restrict access to systems from external networks and between systems internally. By
  default all access is denied and only explicitly allowed ports and protocols are allowed based on business need. Each
  system is assigned to a firewall security group based on the system’s function. Security groups restrict access to
  only the ports and protocols required for a system’s specific function to mitigate risk.</p>

<h4>Spoofing and Sniffing Protections</h4>
<p>Managed firewalls prevent IP, MAC, and ARP spoofing on the network and between virtual hosts to ensure spoofing is
  not possible. Packet sniffing is prevented by infrastructure including the hypervisor which will not deliver traffic
  to an interface which it is not addressed to.</p>

<h4>Port Scanning</h4>
<p>Port scanning is prohibited and every reported instance is investigated by our infrastructure provider. When port
  scans are detected, they are stopped and access is blocked.</p>

<h3>Application Security</h3>
<p>The POPin Platform is a Multi-Tenant architecture, however user access is granted on a ‘per-Question’ basis. User
  verification and password recovery are done via time limited single use links/tokens sent to the registered email.
  Production servers are outfitted to send secure cookies and other security related headers and have been vetted to
  conform to OWASP Security Best Practices.</p>

<h4>SSO</h4>
<p>Customers can simplify their access to our application by using our secure SAML2 SSO integration.</p>

<h3>Data Security</h3>
<h4>Customer Data</h4>
<p>All data is encrypted at rest using AWS Best Practices. Only our POPin Development Team can access data directly and
  only after username, key, and IP authentication.</p>

<h3>Vulnerability Management</h3>
<h4>System</h4>
<p>POPin is notified of vulnerabilities through internal and external assessments, system patch monitoring, and third
  party mailing lists and services. Each vulnerability is reviewed to determine if it is applicable to POPin’s
  environment, ranked based on risk, and assigned accordingly.</p>

<p>We continually apply the latest security updates to all operating systems and applications, in order to mitigate
  exposure to vulnerabilities. This process allows POPin to keep the environment up-to-date.</p>

<h4>Application</h4>
<p>We undergo penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, and source code reviews to assess the security of our
  application, architecture, and implementation. Our third party security assessments cover all areas of our platform
  including testing for OWASP Top 10 web application vulnerabilities. POPin works closely with external security
  assessors to review the security of the POPin platform and apply best practices.</p>

<p>Issues found in POPin applications are risk ranked, prioritized, assigned accordingly for remediation, and POPin’s
  Development Team reviews each remediation plan to ensure proper resolution.</p>

<h3>Backups</h3>
<h4>Customer Data</h4>
<p>Customer Data stored in our POPin platform are automatically backed up every night to secure, access controlled, and
  redundant storage. We use these backups to automatically bring our application back online in the event of an outage.</p>

<h4>POPin Platform</h4>
<p>From our instance images to our databases, each component is backed up to secure, access-controlled, and redundant
  storage. We apply AWS Best Practices to ensure High-Availability of our Infrastructure and Primary Databases. In
  addition to standard backup practices, POPin’s infrastructure is designed to scale and be fault tolerant by
  automatically failing over to healthy instances and reducing the likelihood of any issues being visible to the user.</p>

<h3>Disaster Recovery</h3>
<h4>Customer Data</h4>
<p>The POPin platform is designed to automatically failover to Synced and Redundant databases in the event of the
  failure of our Primary Databases.</p>

<h3>POPin Platform</h3>
<h4>Customer Data Retention and Destruction</h4>
<p>Within 30 days of a written data deletion request, by an authorized representative of the tenant company, we will
  remove tenant related data from the DB. Backed up data will be rotated out of our archives within 30 days after
  deletion from the DB.</p>

<p>Decommissioning hardware is managed by our infrastructure provider using a process designed to prevent customer data
  exposure. AWS uses techniques outlined in DoD 5220.22-M (“National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual “) or
  NIST 800-88 (“Guidelines for Media Sanitization”) to destroy data.</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>POPin has a published privacy policy that clearly defines what data is collected and how it is used. POPin is
  committed to customer privacy, transparency, and the anonymity of our users.</p>

<p>We takes steps to protect the privacy of our customers and protect data stored within the platform. Some of the
  protections inherent to POPin’s products include authentication, access controls, data transport encryption, HTTPS
  restrictions to our platform, and all customer data encrypted at rest. For additional information see: <a title="POPin Privacy Policy"
    href="/privacy-policy">https://staging1.popinnow.com/privacy-policy</a></p>

<h3>Access to Customer Data</h3>
<p>General POPin staff do not access or interact with customer data or applications as part of normal operations. Our
  POPin Customer Success (CS) team does review your data on your behalf as needed, but generally at the request of the
  customer, for support purposes or where required by law. Customer data is access controlled and all access restricted
  to the POPin CS or Developer Team.</p>
