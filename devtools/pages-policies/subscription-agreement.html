        Agreement govern, all previous oral and written communications regarding these matters, all of which are merged
        into this Agreement, except that this Agreement does not supersede any prior nondisclosure or comparable
        agreement between the parties executed prior to this Agreement being executed. No employee, agent, or other
        representative of POP has any authority to bind POP with respect to any statement, representation, warranty, or
        other expression unless the same is specifically set forth in this Agreement. No usage of trade or other
        regular practice or method of dealing between the parties will be used to modify, interpret, supplement, or
        alter the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement may be changed only by a written agreement signed by an
        authorized agent of the party against whom enforcement is sought. POP will not be bound by, and specifically
        objects to, any term, condition or other provision that is different from or in addition to this Agreement
        (whether or not it would materially alter this Agreement) that is proffered by Subscriber in any receipt,
        acceptance, confirmation, correspondence, or otherwise.

        Notice Regarding Apple. If an Authorized User is using an App on an iOS device, the terms of this Section 11.m
        apply. Subscriber acknowledges that this Agreement is between Subscriber and POP only, not with Apple, and
        Apple is not responsible for any App or its content. Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance or
        support services with respect to any App. If an App fails to conform to any applicable warranty, Subscriber may
        notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price for the mobile application to Subscriber; and,
        to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the
        Service. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claim by Subscriber or any third party relating to the
        Service or Subscriber’s possession or use of the Service, including: (a) product liability claims; (b) any
        claim that the Service fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (c) claims
        arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation,
        defense, settlement, or discharge of any third-party claim that the Service or Subscriber’s possession and use
        of the mobile application infringe that third party’s intellectual property rights. Subscriber agrees to comply
        with any applicable third-party terms when using the Service. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party
        beneficiaries of this Section 11.m, and upon Subscriber’s acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the
        right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Section 11.m against Subscriber.
        Subscriber hereby represents and warrants that: (i) Subscriber is not located in a country that is subject to a
        U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting”
        country; and (ii) Subscriber is not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
